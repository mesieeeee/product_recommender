# 🛍️ Product Recommender System

A deep learning-based product recommendation system built using **ResNet50**, **KNN**, and **K-Means**, designed to suggest visually similar products from over 44,000+ images across 70+ categories. Built with **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, and deployed using **Streamlit**.

## 📌 Overview

This system uses **transfer learning** to extract image features and **unsupervised learning** to cluster and recommend similar products. The app interface is powered by Streamlit, allowing users to interactively explore recommendations based on uploaded product images.
